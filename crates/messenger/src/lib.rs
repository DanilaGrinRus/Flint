//! Flint messenger — M1 protocol.
//!
//! The wallet already has an identity: the slatepack address is an ed25519
//! public key. This crate uses it to (a) encrypt a message to the recipient and
//! (b) sign the envelope with the sender key. The relay only learns the
//! recipient address, size and timestamps; the sender address and the payload
//! live inside the ciphertext.
//!
//! Security model for v1:
//! * sender authenticity is verified by the **recipient after decryption**
//!   (the relay cannot verify it and must not be trusted for that);
//! * `plaintext-slatepack` (armor without age encryption) is refused, so a
//!   relay never carries a readable transaction;
//! * TTL is enforced twice: by the mailbox and by the recipient.
